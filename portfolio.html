        <div></div>
        <p>Cocktail-Me is an application that allows a user to explore a database of cocktails and create their
          own drinks. This application also enables a user to create an account and save their collection of cocktails.
        </p>
        <p>This app demonstrates the use of html, css, handlebars, javascript, and many others. This app was also
          created in a group dynamic, displaying my ability to work within a group and meet a deadline.</p>
        <p>I personally worked on the call to the api, javascript including the functions related to saving and
          displaying results. After doing what our group divided among us I assisted my fellow teammates to finish the
          html and css, and made the powerpoint associated with our presentation for this project. </p>

        <div></div>
        <p>Git-fit is an application that is designed to help a user to record their workouts. </p>
        <p>This app demonstrates the use of mongoose, routes, javascript, and working beside models. </p>

        <h4>Breweries</h4>
        <a href=https://github.com/jameslee70/FirstProject target="_blank">Github for Breweries</a>
        <div></div>
        <a href=https://jameslee70.github.io/FirstProject target="_blank">Deployed app for Breweries</a>
        <p>Breweries was a first exposure to using API's and calling/rendering them to the page. This app uses Day.js
          which is used to display the date, along with a weather api to display the weather of the city being searched.
          It then takes the city and state that is searched and runs it through the brewery databse to find the
          breweries in the area. After doing that it gives the user the address, website, and phone number of the
          location if available.
